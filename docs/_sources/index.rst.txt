   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

DarkHDLnet's documentation!
===========================

Yeah bitch, now we have docs!

This project it's a really nice try to implement traditional blocks of
convolutional neural networks in VHDL. The components are build with a lib
from python called MyHDL. The main ideia is use the code implemented to
generate ROMs with the weight and bias values (and major units as layers). The
control unit will be implemented direct in VHDL code in the repo *work* folder.

Take a look in `Darknet project website <http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo>`_ to
get info about the CNN we want to accelerate: Yolov3.

Could be a really nice paper **DarkHDLnet: an efficient hardware and software
co-project implementation of CNNs to FPGA devices** (who knows what future
holds?).

.. py:class:: FixedPointMultiplier

   Bases: :class:`ComponentClass.ComponentClass`

   This class implements a 16 bits fixed point Q5.11 multiplier. The main
   objective of this component is make able the use of registers inside the
   multipliers in the architecture. At first the multipliers offered by the
   FPGA device were potential critical paths as they are indivisible to the
   pipeline stages. Although not used yet, the reset and clk signals are here
   to make the implementation of the registers less painful.

   :param clk: clock signal
   :type clk: std_logic
   :param reset: reset signal
   :type reset: std_logic
   :param param_a: a value unsigned in fixed point representation
   :type param_a: unsigned (actually a signed value)
   :param param_b: other value unsigned in fixed point representation
   :type param_b: unsigned (actually a signed value)
   :param product: the result of parm_a and param_b multiplication in fixed
   point representation.
   :type product: unsigned (actually a signed value)

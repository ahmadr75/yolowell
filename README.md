# Darknet HDL

The main objective of this repository is generate vhd files to use in a co-project implementation of Darknet and Yolo in FPGA devices.

The generated vhd components are extensively replicated in their units, which is why they are transcribed in Python via MyHDL (and I am thinking to change to hwt); so don't think that I don't know how to program in VHDL (at some point that phrase sounds funny to me). The darknet in repo name is just to seems a cool project.
